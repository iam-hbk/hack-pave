When you need to install anything always check [package.json](mdc:package.json) first if it's not intalled and I use pnpm as my package manager
this is a nextjs app router dir application

- before installing anything check [package-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/package-management.mdc)
- we use pnpm as a package manager
- shadcn is used for the ui
to install a shadcn component, use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]` eg. pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
- use the components folder at root of the project when needed to create a component
- never create a components directory under the app folder.
